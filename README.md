Welcome to the official documentation repository for **DailyBite** – an open-source application designed to deliver daily food inspiration. Whether you're cooking at home or deciding where to order from, DailyBite helps you make that choice with a smart, AI-powered engine.



## Project Overview

**DailyBite** is a modern food suggestion platform that leverages intelligent APIs and clean architecture to provide personalized meal ideas. The application supports both home-cooked recipes and recommendations for takeout options — all tailored to the user’s language and preferences.



## Architecture & Technical Flow

### - Authentication
- **People API** handles authentication and authorization.
- Uses [`huzcodes.Extensions`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/huzcodes.Extensions) for JWT generation.

### - Recipe Logic
- **Recipes API** processes requests after authentication.
- Users provide:
  - Preferred **language**
  - Preference to **cook** or **order**
- Application calls **OpenAI API** with those parameters.
- Results are:
  - Stored in a **SQL Database**
  - Tagged with a **unique key** to prevent duplication
  - Archived after 30 days, with the option to reuse or regenerate

### - Internal Communication
- A **gRPC Skeleton Service** facilitates communication between People API and Recipes API.

### - Frontend
- **Web App**: Built with **Blazor**
- **Mobile App**: Built with **.NET MAUI**
